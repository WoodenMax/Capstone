        As I said, the problem is the lack of awareness people have about NASA and it's benefits.
        Thanks to this, they think that funding NASA is useless, and thanks to that, NASA recives far too little funding for what it does.
        NASA creates or improves all kinds of technologies, ranging from ones in your home, such as memory foam mattresses, ear thermermoneters, cell phone cameras, and adjustable smoke detectors, to technologies for specific industrial and commercial purposes, like a 3d printer that can print electronics, safer grooved highways, aerogel insulation, and even fire fighter gear!
